            It's great for those who enjoy the tropes of: tsundere love-interest, enemies to lovers, and adventure.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's grown to become one of my favorite movies and I totally reccomend it for any of those looking for something to watch in their spare time.

            Howl's Moving Castle is one of the most popular Studio Ghibli movies and it's popular for a reason. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this movie. In between the lines you can find philosophical observations on how humans tend to behave, all while also allowing us to imagine a world of selflessness.

            Howl's Moving Castle is about a girl named Sophie, and unconfident woman who isn't all too keen on romance and living in a fantasy of being picked up by some man. When she is cursed with an old body by a spiteful witch, her only chance of breaking the spell lies with a self-indulgent yet insecure young wizard and his companions in his legged, walking castle.
